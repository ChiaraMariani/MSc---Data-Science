February 2025 - Project for _Service Science_ course

In this project, we had to think of a possible idea for a startup and then try to test our initial assumptions through an MVP.

We developed the idea of DressApp, an application targeted at people who don't want the burden of having to choose what to wear every morning. DressApp will pick an outfit for you based on your closet's clothes, your style, what you have available and what is in the laundry basket, the weather and other factors.

DressApp also lets you explore other people's wardrobe, as well as shop from your favourite brands and within your style; with the app knowing your everything clothing item and preferred style from social media you can always be sure to have the best fit and the ideal advertisment experience, with items of your size and style coming right when you need them.

A small mockup of DressApp is available here: https://readymag.website/u3849747717/5169269/ (keep in mind this was just a prototype to test assumptions)

**Important notice:** the App Mockup only works when opening the link from a smartphone!

DressApp interacts with brands through DressAds, its Advertisement and market research platform. Given the amount of granular data DressApp has, coupled with the fact that most DressApp users are not interested in fashion, the potential to reach new customers with an unprecedented personalisation is limitless. A small MVP of DressAds can be found here instead: https://readymag.website/u3555102290/5161943/

**Important notice:** the WebPage Mockup only works when opening the link from a pc, not a mobile device!
