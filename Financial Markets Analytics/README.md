July 2024 - Project for _Financial Markets Analytics_ course

This project investigates how tilting investment portfolios based on different risk and performance metrics affects returns compared to the S&P 500. Using a 180-day rolling regression and the classical Market Model, we analyze key parameters such as alpha, beta, RÂ², and both systematic and specific risk for each stock in the S&P 500.

Eight portfolios were constructed based on these metrics (e.g., high alpha, low specific risk), and their performance was compared against the index using return charts and risk-adjusted measures like the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. Data was sourced from Yahoo Finance, Wikipedia, and FactSet, covering the period from June 2017 to July 2024.

The findings highlight that low specific risk portfolios achieved strong risk-adjusted returns, while high-risk portfolios underperformed despite higher volatility. The results suggest that minimizing idiosyncratic risk while maintaining market exposure leads to more efficient portfolios.
