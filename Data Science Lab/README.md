This project analyzes the rising issue of financial frauds in the digital age, focusing on the Italian context. 

Utilizing a 2017 Bank of Italy survey of approximately 2500 individuals, our research employs Machine Learning techniques to identify factors linked to fraud vulnerability. The process involved cleaning the dataset, engineering new features representing financial attributes, and applying classification models evaluated using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient while addressing data imbalance.

Our key findings challenge some common stereotypes: while factors such as being in debt and perceived financial knowledge are identified as linked to vulnerability, the analysis strongly suggests that fraud is a systematic issue that affects people across all socio-demographic classes.
