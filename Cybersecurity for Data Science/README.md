January 2025 - Project for _Cybersecurity for Data Science_ course

This project explores the Wiener attack, a significant cryptanalysis technique targeting the RSA cryptosystem. While RSA's security is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, it can be compromised when short secret exponents are used.

The Research file details the mathematical foundations behind this attack, explains the Wiener test used to identify the correct private key candidate, and discusses the limitations of the attack, highlighting the crucial trade-off between performance and security when choosing RSA key parameters.
