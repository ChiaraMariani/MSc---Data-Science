January 2024 - Project for _Machine Learning_ course

This project explores student alcohol consumption using machine learning classification models. Based on data collected in Portuguese schools during the 2005–2006 academic year available on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption, the goal is to predict alcohol use among students based on personal, family, and academic features.

We used KNIME Analytics Platform to build the entire analysis pipeline and we compare three different classifiers: Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, evaluated across multiple validation methods (Holdout, Iterated Holdout, Cross Validation, and Leave-One-Out).

Performance was measured using accuracy, F-measure, and AUC, supported by ROC curves and confidence intervals. The results highlight which features most influence alcohol consumption and which model combinations offer the best predictive performance.
