January 2024 - Project for _Data Visualization_ course

This project compares Airbnb accommodations in London and Amsterdam using interactive visualizations (Tableau) to explore key factors such as room type, price range, proximity to subway, and distance from the city center.

We used the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities?rvi=1 from Kaggle, cleaned and preprocessed it with RStudio, and built an interactive dashboard in Tableau.
