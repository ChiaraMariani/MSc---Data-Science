Febraury 2024 - Project for _Data Management_ course

This project investigates the potential influence of weather conditions at departure on non-commercial flight delays. We collected data from seven international airports located in diverse climate zones between December 2023 and February 2024.

Data acquisition involved web scraping for flight and airport information, using a public API (Open-Meteo) for weather data (precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed at 10m and 100m), and file download for IATA codes. The dataset underwent significant cleaning, integration, and enrichment to create a unified structure, and was stored in a MongoDB database.
